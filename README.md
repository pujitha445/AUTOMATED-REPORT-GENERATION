 This project demonstrates advanced data analysis and visualization using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The dataset represents monthly sales performance across three business categories—Electronics, Clothing, and Grocery. The analysis includes data preprocessing, calculation of total and average sales, and extraction of key business insights. Multiple visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts are used to clearly present sales trends, category-wise contributions, and overall performance. This project is useful for understanding real-world business analytics, identifying growth patterns, supporting data-driven decision-making, and showcasing Python-based data analysis skills. It is ideal for applications in business intelligence, sales forecasting, retail analytics, and as a portfolio project for data analyst or data science roles.
